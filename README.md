# Interactive-Dictionary-Python
Interactive dictionary written in Python.
The user provides the word in English and receives its definition(s). The app also has a feature of deleting the words/definition(s)
from the dictionary, as well as adding the new ones.
Run the console.py program for the console version of the dictionary.
Run the gui.py program for the gui version of the dictionary (main.py is a backened for gui version).
Before running the program make sure that data.json file is in the same directory.
The problems with the program:
1. It uses json file instead of database so there would be a performence issues if the size of the file would grow too much.
